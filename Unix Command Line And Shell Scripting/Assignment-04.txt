Create a simple script that does the following:

Echo a full sentence to the terminal
Echo a different full sentence, but redirect it to /dev/null

Run and display the results and make sure the statements appear where intended.


Ans:

function cap(){
    echo "Hey I am Pratiksha"
    echo "Good to see you" 1>&2
}
echo "Assignment completed $(cap 2>/dev/null)"

Output: Assignment completed Hey I am Pratiksha
