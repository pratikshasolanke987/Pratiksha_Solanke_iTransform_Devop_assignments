Write a script that will prompt the user to enter a number between 1 and 3. Capture that number in a variable and then test that variable. Be sure to display the variable and it's value as appropriate within an if/then/else statement where the final statement will display if they did not enter a number between 1 and 3 telling them they failed to follow instructions. Redirect errors from each of the tests to /dev/null (to prevent script errors from showing if text is entered for example).

Ans:

if [[ $1 -gt 0 ]] && [[ $1 -lt 4 ]]
then
  echo "$1 is my correct number"
elif [[ $1 -gt 3 ]]
then
  echo "$1 is a wrong number"
else
 function cap(){
    echo "Good to see you" 1>&2
 }
  echo "$(cap 2>/dev/null)"
fi

Output:

ifelse.sh 4
4 is a wrong number
ifelse.sh 3
3 is my correct number
ifelse.sh 0
