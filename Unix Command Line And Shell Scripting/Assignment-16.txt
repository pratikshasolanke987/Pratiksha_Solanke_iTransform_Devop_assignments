Create a simple text file containing a list of super heros (or some names if preferred), use at least four values, one per line in the file.

Write a bash shell script that then reads that file and displays it line by line on the terminal window.


Ans:
echo "Enter filename"
read filename

 

if [[ -f "$filename" ]]
then
while IFS= read -r line
do
echo "$line"
done < $filename
else
echo "$filename doesn't exist"
fi

 Output:

Enter filename
superHeroes.sh
Captian America
Wonder Women
Black Widow
Hulk
