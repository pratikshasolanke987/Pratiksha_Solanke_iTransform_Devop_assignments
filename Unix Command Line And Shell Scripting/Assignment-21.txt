Create a simple script containing a single function. This function should display a message to clearly indicate it was generated when the function was run. Then, display another message outside the function clearly indicating it was generated outside of it.

Ans:

function funcCheck()
{
    returningValue="generated inside the function"

}
returningValue="generated outside the function"
echo $returningValue
funcCheck
echo $returningValue


output:
 math.sh
generated outside the function
generated inside the function
