We need to create a menu for our users. Display a menu containing three choices AND a choice to allow them to exit. Display that menu and prompt for a choice. Upon choosing the value, it should simply clear the screen and redisplay the menu (loop until the exit choice is given).

HOWEVER, we need to be sure that the end user cannot use CTL-C, CTL-Z or a KILL command to terminate the application. Add a 'trap' in the script to capture those attempts and provide instructions on how to exit the script using the menu choice instead.

Ans:
ctrlc_count=0

function no_ctrlc()
{
    let ctrlc_count++
    echo
    if [[ $ctrlc_count == 1 ]]; then
        echo "Stop that."
    elif [[ $ctrlc_count == 2 ]]; then
        echo "Once more and I quit."
    else
        echo "That's it.  I quit."
        exit
    fi
}

PS3='Please enter your choice: '
options=("Option 1" "Option 2" "Option 3" "Quit")

select opt in "${options[@]}"
do
    case $opt in
        "Option 1")
            echo "you chose choice 1"
            ;;
        "Option 2")
            echo "you chose choice 2"
            ;;
        "Option 3")
            echo "you chose choice $REPLY which is $opt"
            ;;
        "Quit")
             break
                        ;;
        *) 
            trap no_ctrlc SIGINT

            while true
            do
                echo Sleeping
                sleep 10
            done
        echo "invalid option $REPLY";;
        
    esac

done
