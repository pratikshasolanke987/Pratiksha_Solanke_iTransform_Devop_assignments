Create a script that interacts with the user. You will want to prompt the user to enter the following information (which you will capture and place into the following variables):

FIRSTNAME
LASTNAME
USERAGE

Greet the user with their name and current age displayed and then calculate and display their age in 10 years.



Ans:
echo "FIRSTNAME: $1"
echo "SECONDNAME: $2"
echo "USERAGE: $3"
num=$(($3+10))
echo "Hello $1 $2 $num"

 user.sh pratiksha solanke 10

Output:
FIRSTNAME: Pratiksha
SECONDNAME: Solanke
USERAGE: 10
Hello Pratiksha Solanke 20
