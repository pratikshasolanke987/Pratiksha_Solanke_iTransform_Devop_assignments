Create a script that interacts with the user. Prompt them to guess a secret number between 1 and 5. Read the guess from the terminal and assign it to a variable. Using the 'if' statement from the course, test that value to determine if they guessed the right number (you choose the correct value). If they do, display a success message, otherwise do nothing.


Ans:
if [[ $1 -gt 1 ]] && [[ $1 -lt 5 ]]
then
  echo "You guessed the right number"
  echo "$1 Is Correct"
fi


output:
You guessed the right number
4 Is Correct
