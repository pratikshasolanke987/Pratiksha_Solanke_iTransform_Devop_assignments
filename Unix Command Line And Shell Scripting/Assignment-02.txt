Write a script that sets FOUR variables:

MYUSERNAME
MYPASSWORD
STARTOFSCRIPT
ENDOFSCRIPT

Populate the first two with some default value and use command redirection to set the third and fourth value to the date/time of when the script was started and completed. Within the script, be sure to display the values to the terminal when run.


Ans:
MYUSERNAME="Pratiksha"
MYPASSWORD="xxxxxx"
STARTOFSCRIPT="#!/usr/bin/env bash"
ENDOFSCRIPT=$(date)
 echo "$MYUSERNAME"
 echo "$MYPASSWORD"
 echo "$STARTOFSCRIPT"
 echo "$ENDOFSCRIPT"

Output:
Pratiksha
xxxxxx
#!/usr/bin/env bash
